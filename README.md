Add the flex.js script as a new userscript.

The first time the script loads, it will ask you to specify your default settings (shifts and hours worked per day). 
These will then be used if you choose to fill a default time sheet.

To use the script, wait until the flex page is fully loaded, then click the 'Fill in defaults' button.
All working days will be prefilled with the hours and shifts you selected (holidays and weekends are skipped)
Afterwards, you still need to remove the days you didn't work and add the holidays/weekend hours you did work.

If you select the "Log hours" checkbox, you can click a date in the calendar to enter/change the number of hours you worked that day.
