Add the flex.js script as a new userscript
If you want to, you can update the hours to match your working times.

To use the script, wait until the flex page is fully loaded, then click the 'Defaults' button.
All working days will be prefilled with the hours you selected (holidays and weekends are skipped)
Afterwards, you still need to remove the days you didn't work and add the holidays/weekend hours you did work.
